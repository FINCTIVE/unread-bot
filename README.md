I found that the Telegram Saved Messages is a better tool for unread links. 

But it is not posible to find deleted links. So I developed this bot! 

feature:

- Send messages to the bot, it will remember all the links included in the message.
- View history links.
- When you finish reading, just delete that massage.
- When you send a long message to the bot with many links, the bot will reply each of the links one by one. (import)
